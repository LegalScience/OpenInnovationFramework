#1. Statement of Intent

Whereas, it is the policy of the City of Boston to practice Open Government, favoring participation, transparency, collaboration and engagement with the people of the City and it’s stakeholders; and

Whereas, information technologies, including web-based and other Internet applications and services, are an essential means for Open Government, and good government generally; and

Whereas, the City of Boston should continue, expand and deepen the City’s innovative use of information technology toward the end of Open Government, including development and use of mobile computing and applications, provision of online data, services and transactions; and

Whereas, the City of Boston also has an obligation to protect some data based upon privacy, confidentiality and other requirements and must ensure that protected data not be released in violation of applicable constraints; and

Whereas, the City of Boston has the opportunity to share civic technologies that it develops with other municipalities by offering the source code under various open source licenses; and, 

Whereas, clarification and definition of open source, open data, privacy, security requirements, interoperability and interaction flows is necessary for the City’s Open Government agenda;

Now therefore, the City of Boston Chief Information Officer (“CIO”), in consultation with City departments, is issuing the following two draft City of Boston policies:

#[2. Open & Controlled Data Policy](OpenAndControlledDataPolicy.md);

 1.      guidance for departments on the classification of their data sets as public or protected and a method to report such classification to the CIO. 
 2.      standards for the format and publishing of open data and guidance on accessibility, re-use and minimum documentation for such data;
 3.      standards on the management of Protected Data – such as certain health or education data, including guidance on security and other controls to safeguard Protected Data
 4.      guidelines for compliance with legal or other rules requiring the sharing of Protected Data with authorized parties upon the grant of consent, by operation of law or when otherwise so required;
 5.      a method to ensure approval by the Corporation Counsel of the City of Boston obtains to Protected Data disclosed in accordance with the Policy.
 
#[3. Open Source License Policy](OpenSourceLicenseGuidelines.md);


- This policy includes:
 - the standards that will govern the City’s selection of an appropriate open source license;
 - sample alternative licenses that can be used for special cases.
 - the City of Boston "ShareBack" provision describing how to notify and provide innovative modifications or new code to the larger community;

#[4. Guidelines on Use of GitHub for Policy Maintanance and Public Engagement](GitPol.md);


In keeping with the intent of these documents, these policies will be hosted on GitHub – or similar public site – so that interested parties can read them, recommend edits, and reuse them as appropriate.
